# My-Analysis-Projects
This is a record of practice on data analysis and data visualization using python.

This record mainly contains practice using matplotlib.pyplot, Numpy and Pandas.

## What's matplotlib.pyplot?

Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.

pylab combines pyplot with numpy into a single namespace. This is convenient for interactive work, but for programming it is recommended that the namespaces be kept separate, e.g.:

## What's Numpy?

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers.
